## How to use and adopt this bucket

1. Click on `Use this template` to create new repository in your account with same files
1. Give your bucket in new name inside github project settings
1. Add proper description of repository
    - Information about what type of manifests could be found here
1. Add `scoop-bucket` tag for repository
    - Your manifests will be automatically available at <https://scoop.netlify.com/apps/> and <https://scoop.netlify.com/buckets/>
1. Enable appveyor CI/CD
    1. Register / Login to [Appveyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/login)
    1. Click `New Project`
    1. From Left Panel choose your source control variant (Github)
    1. From Right Panel choose repository with bucket and click `+ Add`
    1. 🎉 Project created and ready to build 🎉
    1. Get Badge URL
        1. Open Appveyor Project settings
        1. Navigate to Badges
        1. Copy `Branch Sample markdown code` snippet for further usage
            - Only master branch is better, since you can freely test in other branches and do not mystificate users.
1. Clone project into some folder
1. Open vscode with this clone
1. Run `git remote add 'upstream' 'https://github.com/Ash258/GenericBucket.git'`
    - This step will allow you to synchronize changes with this template repository
    - If some changes are pushed into this repository and you want to reflect them into your bucket, you can simply do something like:
        - `git fetch --all`
        - `git checkout -B upstream-master -t upstream/master`
        - Do changes
        - `git merge master` or create PR in github
1. Create proper README.md
    1. Open `README.template.md`
    1. Replace all `%%templatestring%%` with real and according values
        1. Replace appveyor status badge with yours
            - See: <https://www.appveyor.com/docs/status-badges/>
    1. Override this README with completed `README.template.md`
    1. Remove template `README.template.md`
1. 🎉🎉 Everything set. You are ready to write and share manifests. 🎉🎉
